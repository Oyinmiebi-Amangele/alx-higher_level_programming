# Project Title: Learning If/Else, Loops, and Functions in Python

This project was completed during the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. Its main objective is to gain a better understanding of if/else statements, loops, range, and functions in the Python programming language.

## Technologies

The project uses the following technologies:

- Python Scripts: Written with Python 3
- C Files: Compiled using gcc 4.8.4
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
