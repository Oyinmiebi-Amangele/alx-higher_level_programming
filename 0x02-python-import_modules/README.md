# Import & Modules

This project was completed as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. It aimed to teach the concepts of importing functions, creating modules, and using command line arguments in Python.

## Technologies

- Python Scripts are written with Python 3.8.5
- C files are compiled using gcc 
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
