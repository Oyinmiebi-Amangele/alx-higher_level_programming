# Exceptions Project

This project was completed as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering curriculum at ALX. The project focuses on learning about exceptions in Python, how to handle them, work with errors, and raise custom exceptions.

## Technologies

- Python scripts are written using Python 3.8.10.
- C files are compiled using gcc.
- The project was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
